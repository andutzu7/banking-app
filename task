"Design a banking system that can perceive a commission for all its users.
Each user has a debit account and optionally a credit account.
Deposits, withdraws and balance checks can be performed on this accounts.
The debit account cannot have a negative balance and the credit account cannot exceed a credit limit.
The bank will try to take the commission from the debit account first and then from the credit one.
If there are insufficient funds, a partial commission is taken.
Write a Java program for the banking system that prints a report on the console with the amount collected
by the bank and the commission value from all the users together with the balance of their accounts.
You can hard code the input data in the application. You can use integer values. "
